# PMF (Product-Market Fit) Narrative — Space Haven Planner

## 1. Problem Statement

**The problem:** Space Haven players want to iterate on ship layouts quickly, but doing layout iteration inside the game is slow and expensive (time + rebuild churn). It’s also hard to share layouts in an editable form with friends or the community.

**How people solve it today:**

- Build in-game, then delete/move things repeatedly (trial-and-error).
- Use screenshots + draw over them.
- Use spreadsheets / graph paper / generic grid tools.
- Share layouts as images (hard to remix).

**Why current solutions fail:**

- In-game iteration is slow and punishing for experimentation.
- Generic tools don’t know Space Haven structures, sizes, or common layout patterns.
- Images are not editable; advice from others is hard to apply precisely.

## 2. Target Customer Archetype

**Primary persona:** “Alex”, 28 — plays Space Haven a few nights a week, likes optimizing but also wants to avoid wasting in-game hours on rebuilds.

**Day in their life:**

- Gets an idea for a ship layout or a new subsystem upgrade.
- Wants to test multiple variants quickly (airlocks, corridors, power, storage flow).
- Shares a draft with friends to sanity-check before committing in-game.

**Where they hang out online:**

- Space Haven community wiki ([Space Haven Wiki](https://spacehaven.fandom.com/wiki/Space_Haven_Wiki))
- Discord communities and Steam discussion boards
- Reddit and YouTube comment sections for ship builds

**What they’re already paying for:**

- The game itself
- Mostly expects planning tools to be free; will sometimes tip/donate if the tool saves real time

## 3. Value Proposition

**One-liner:** A free, browser-based Space Haven ship layout planner that works without accounts and lets you iterate, save, export, and share layouts in minutes.

**Unlike:** sketching in spreadsheets, drawing apps, or rebuilding in-game

**We:** provide a Space Haven-aware grid planner (structures, sizes, layers, keyboard shortcuts, exports)

**So that:** players can design and optimize layouts faster and avoid expensive in-game rebuild loops.

## 4. Competitive Moat

This is a utility product; the moat is mostly execution + distribution rather than proprietary tech.

**Initial moat (Day 1):**

- Best-in-class UX for Space Haven layout iteration (fast, offline-first, no accounts).
- Reliable structure catalog + consistent tile math.

**Moat after 100 customers:**

- Community adoption: links from guides, Discord pins, wiki references.
- Feedback loop that improves defaults, shortcuts, and catalog correctness.

**Moat after 1000 customers:**

- Brand recognition as the “default” Space Haven planner.
- SEO from shared links and community references.

## 5. Go-to-Market Strategy

**First 10 users:**

- Post a demo (GIF/video) in Space Haven communities; ask for feedback on friction points.
- DM a few active ship-build posters and ask if they’ll try it and report issues.

**First 100 users:**

- Release “v1” with shareable links + exports (people share builds).
- Publish 2–3 example layouts as templates users can remix.

**First 1000 users:**

- Keep improving UX and structure catalog; get referenced by guides/tutorials.
- Add small quality-of-life features that matter for long sessions (undo/redo, search, move tool).

---

## 6. Business Model

**Pricing:** Free.

**Monetization:** Donationware (no accounts, no subscriptions).

- Add a small “Support this project” link/button (Buy Me a Coffee / Ko-fi / PayPal donate).
- Optionally offer cosmetic supporter perks that don’t require accounts (e.g., local theme toggle) — only if it doesn’t add friction or complexity.

**Cost to serve one user:** near-zero (static hosting + domain).

**Customer acquisition cost:** near-zero (community distribution).

**Break-even point:** a handful of monthly donations typically covers hosting + domain.
